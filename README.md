# Arithmetic_Formatter
 This Python project is part of a FreeCodeCamp learning challenge. It formats and displays simple arithmetic problems in a structured way, similar to how they appear on paper. The program supports addition and subtraction, ensures input validation, and optionally displays the answers.
